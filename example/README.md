# read_pdf_text_example

Demonstrates how to use the read_pdf_text plugin.

## Getting Started

run commands:
	flutter pub get
	flutter run

There are three examples in the pdf_reader.dart file. I'm using the file_picker package to get file paths.
This is recommended as to not use faulty paths.

```dart
	getPDFtext()
	getPDFtextPaginated()
	getPDFlength()
```
